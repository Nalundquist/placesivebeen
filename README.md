test: anything under the prototype destination has traits: location, landmarks, best season, notes

code: let sea = destination("Seattle", "Space Needle", "Summer", "Passive Aggressive lol")
console.log(sea);

Expected output: "Location: "Seattle", Landmarks: "Space Needle", Best Season: "Summer", Other Notes: "Passive Aggressive lol"
